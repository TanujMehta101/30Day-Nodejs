```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
```

fs stands for "file system," and it is a built-in module that provides functionality related to file operations. 
For example, you can use fs.readFile to read the content of a file or fs.writeFile to write content to a file asynchronously.
Here's a breakdown of the statement:

require('fs'): This is a built-in Node.js function used to import modules. The argument passed to require is the name of the module you want to import. In this case, it's 'fs', which refers to the file system module.

const fs: This declares a constant variable named fs. The const keyword is used to create a variable that cannot be reassigned to a different value after its initial assignment. By convention, the name fs is used to represent the file system module.

```javascript
function readFileContent(filePath) {
    // Asynchronous file read operation
    fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8', (err, data) => {
        if (err) {
            // Handle error and print to console
            console.error(`Error reading file: ${err.message}`);
            return;
        }

        // Print the file content to the console
        console.log('File Content:');
        console.log(data);
    });
}
```
 **Let's break down the readFileContent function step by step:**
function readFileContent(filePath) {: This line defines a function named readFileContent that takes a single parameter filePath, representing the path to the file you want to read.

fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8', (err, data) => {: This line initiates an asynchronous file read operation using the readFile method from the fs module. It takes three arguments:

filePath: The path to the file to be read.
'utf8': The encoding of the file, which specifies how the file should be interpreted. In this case, it's set to 'utf8' for reading text files.
(err, data) => { is an arrow function that serves as the callback function to be executed once the file read operation is completed. It takes two parameters:
err: An error object, which will be null if there are no errors during the file read operation.
data: The content of the file read, represented as a string.
if (err) {: This conditional statement checks if there was an error during the file read operation. If err is not null, it means an error occurred.

console.error(Error reading file: ${err.message});: If an error occurred, this line prints an error message to the console, including the error message obtained from err.message.
return;: This return statement exits the function immediately, preventing the code below from being executed in case of an error.

console.log('File Content:');: If no error occurred, this line prints a message to the console indicating that the following output is the content of the file.

console.log(data);: This line prints the content of the file (retrieved in the data parameter of the callback function) to the console.

The overall purpose of this function is to read the content of a file asynchronously, handle any errors that might occur during the process, and print the content to the console if the operation is successful.

Remember that the use of asynchronous operations is preferred in Node.js for tasks like file reading to ensure that your application remains responsive and doesn't block other tasks while waiting for I/O operations to complete.
