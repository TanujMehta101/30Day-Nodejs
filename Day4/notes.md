A **relative path** is a way to specify the location of a file or directory with **respect to a current working directory**. 
Unlike **absolute paths**, which specify the **complete path from the root directory**.

Here are some key concepts related to relative paths:

Current Working Directory (CWD):

Single-Dot (.) and Double-Dot (..):

. represents the **current directory**.
.. represents the **parent directory**.
Examples of Relative Paths:

./subdirectory/file.txt: Specifies a file named file.txt located in the subdirectory within the current working directory.
../parent_directory/file.txt: Specifies a file named file.txt located in the parent_directory (one level up from the current working directory).
