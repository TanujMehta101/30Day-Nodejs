```javascript
const express = require('express');
```
This line imports the Express framework, which is a popular Node.js framework for building web applications.

```function requestLoggerMiddleware(req, res, next) {
```
This line defines a middleware function named requestLoggerMiddleware. It takes three parameters: req (the request object), res (the response object), and next (a callback function to pass control to the next middleware function).

```const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
```
This line creates a timestamp representing the current time in UTC timezone in ISO format (e.g., "2024-02-19T12:30:45.678Z").

```const method = req.method;
```
This line extracts the HTTP method used in the incoming request (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) from the req object.

```console.log(`${timestamp} - ${method} request received`);
``
This line logs a message to the console, containing the timestamp and HTTP method of the incoming request in the specified format.

```next();
```
This line calls the next() function to pass control to the next middleware function in the stack. This allows the Express application to continue processing subsequent middleware or route handlers.

```const app = express();
```
This line creates an instance of the Express application, which will be used to define routes, middleware, and start the server.

```app.use(requestLoggerMiddleware);
```
This line applies the requestLoggerMiddleware middleware function to all incoming requests to the Express application. Middleware functions are executed sequentially in the order they are defined, and they can intercept and modify incoming requests or outgoing responses.

```
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});
```
This line defines a route handler for GET requests to the root URL ("/"). When a GET request is made to the root URL, the server responds with the string "Hello World!".

```app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```
This line starts the Express application server, listening on port 3000. When the server starts successfully, it logs a message to the console indicating that the server is running. Clients can now send requests to the server, and the server will respond accordingly.
