In Node.js, middleware refers to functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. Middleware functions can execute any code, make changes to the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware function in the stack.

Middleware functions are essential in Node.js applications, especially in web frameworks like Express.js, to perform tasks such as:

Logging: Logging request details, such as HTTP method, URL, timestamp, etc.
Authentication: Checking if a user is authenticated before allowing access to protected routes.
Authorization: Determining if a user has permission to access certain resources.
Error handling: Catching and handling errors that occur during request processing.
Request preprocessing: Parsing request bodies, validating input data, etc.
Response manipulation: Adding headers, compressing response data, etc.
CORS handling: Enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for API requests from different origins.
Rate limiting: Limiting the number of requests a client can make within a certain time frame.
Request validation: Validating request parameters, headers, payloads, etc.
Security: Implementing security measures like XSS protection, CSRF protection, etc.

Middleware functions are typically passed as arguments to route handler functions in Express.js. They can be mounted globally, meaning they are executed for every incoming request, or locally, meaning they are only executed for specific routes.

Here's a simple example of middleware logging the request method and URL:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware function
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log(`[${new Date().toISOString()}] ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
    next(); // Pass control to the next middleware function
});

// Route handler
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World!');
});

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```
In this example, the middleware logs the request method and URL for every incoming request. The next() function is called to pass control to the next middleware function in the stack. If next() is not called within a middleware function, the request-response cycle will be terminated, and no further middleware or route handlers will be executed.
