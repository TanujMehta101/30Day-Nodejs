```javascript
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();
```
This section imports necessary modules.
express is the Express.js framework.
path is a Node.js core module used for working with file paths.
app is an instance of the Express application, which will be used to define routes and start the server.

```javascript
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
```
This line sets up Express to serve static files located in the "public" directory.
express.static() is middleware provided by Express for serving static files.
path.join(__dirname, 'public') constructs the absolute path to the "public" directory using the __dirname global variable, which represents the directory name of the currently executing script, and concatenating it with 'public'.
This middleware will intercept requests for static files (like CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) and serve them from the specified directory.

```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'index.html'));
});
```
This line defines a route handler for the root URL ("/").
When a GET request is made to the root URL, this handler is triggered.
res.sendFile() is used to send the "index.html" file located in the "public" directory as the response.
Again, path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'index.html') constructs the absolute path to the "index.html" file.
used to join together multiple path segments into a single path

```javascript
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```
This line starts the Express application server, listening on port 3000.
When the server starts successfully, it logs a message to the console indicating that the server is running.
Overall, this code sets up an Express server to serve static files from the "public" directory, with the root URL ("/") returning the "index.html" file from that directory.
